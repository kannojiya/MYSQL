# MYSQLWhat is Database?
A database is a separate application that stores a collection of data. Each database
has one or more distinct APIs for creating, accessing, managing, searching and
replicating the data it holds.
Other kinds of data stores can be used, such as files on the file system or large hash
tables in memory, but data fetching and writing would not be so fast and easy with
those types of systems.
So nowadays, we use relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store
and manage huge volume of data. This is called relational database because all the
data is stored into different tables and relations are established using primary keys or
other keys known as foreign keys.
A Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS) is a software that:
Enables you to implement a database with tables, columns and indexes.
Guarantees the Referential Integrity between rows of various tables.
Updates the indexes automatically.
Interprets an SQL query and combines information from various tables.
RDBMS Terminology:
Before we proceed to explain MySQL database system, let's revise few definitions related to database.
Database: A database is a collection of tables, with related data.
Table: A table is a matrix with data. A table in a database looks like a simple
spreadsheet.
Column: One column (data element) contains data of one and the same kind, for
example the column postcode.
Row: A row (= tuple, entry or record) is a group of related data, for example the data
of one subscription.
Redundancy: Storing data twice, redundantly to make the system faster.
Primary Key: A primary key is unique. A key value can not occur twice in one table.
With a key, you can find at most one row.
Foreign Key: A foreign key is the linking pin between two tables.
